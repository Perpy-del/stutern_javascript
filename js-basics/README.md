#### Question 6
Differentiate between Statically typed and Dynamically typed programming languages and give examples of languages that fall under each category

Answer:
Statistically typed programming languages are languages in which a programmer must declare the variables clearly before using them. Once the variables are cast in a statically typed programming, they cannot be converted into another type of variable. Also, using a variable if you have not declared it will result in an error. Dynamically typed languages are languages that you don't have to declare. Also, the variables don't have to be typed into a particular type.

Also statically types programming languages are compiled when executed. Dynamically typed languages are interpreted when executed. Statically typed languages catch errors during the early stages of programming. It prevents the changing of variables which leaves no room for errors. Dynamic programming catches errors during the execution which slows down the programming process.

Dynamically typed languages are more flexible than statically typed languages. This is because it allows the changing of variable types.

*Examples of statically typed languages includes C, C++ and Java*

*Examples of dynamically typed langauges includes Python, Javascript, Perl, Ruby and Lua.*

#### Question 7
Differentiate between the JavaScript data types ‘null’ and ‘undefined'?

Answer:
The undefined property indicates that a variable has nto been declared at all. The value null represents the absence of any object value.
