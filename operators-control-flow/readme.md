# Javascript Operators & Control Flow

### Create a folder and name it ‘operators-control-flow’. Put the answers to Questions 1, 2 and 4 in a file named ‘readme.md’. For the coding questions, create a file and name it ‘index.js’. Use comments to label your answers.

#### Task 1: List the symbols for each of the below Javascript operators.

-   Arithmetic Operators - used to assign values to variables.
The symbols are: =, +=, -=, *=, /= and %=.

*Example1:*
`let firstName = "Perpetual";`  // This assigns the string Perpetual to the variable firstName.

*Example2:*
`let num = 10;`  // This assigns the number 10 to the variable num.


-   Assignment Operators - used to perform primary arithmetic operations.
The symbols are: +, -, *, / and %.

*Example:*
`let add = num1 + num2;` 

This adds the value assigned to num1 and num2 and assigns it to the variable add.
