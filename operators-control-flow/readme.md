# Javascript Operators & Control Flow

## Create a folder and name it ‘operators-control-flow’. Put the answers to Questions 1, 2 and 4 in a file named ‘readme.md’. For the coding questions, create a file and name it ‘index.js’. Use comments to label your answers.

### Task 1: List the symbols for each of the below Javascript operators.

-   **Arithmetic Operators** - used to assign values to variables.
The symbols are: =, +=, -=, *=, /= and %=.

*Example1:*
`let firstName = "Perpetual";`  // This assigns the string Perpetual to the variable firstName.

*Example2:*
`let num = 10;`  // This assigns the number 10 to the variable num.


-   **Assignment Operators** - used to perform primary arithmetic operations.
The symbols are: +, -, *, / and %.

*Example1:*
`let add = num1 + num2;`  // This adds the value assigned to num1 and num2 and assigns it to the variable add.

*Example2:*
`let x += 2;`  // This adds the 2 to the value assigned to x and assigns the result to x.


-   **Comparison Operartors** - used to determine equality or difference between variables or values. They are used to test for true or false.
The symbols are: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=.

*Example1:*
```javascript
 let x = 2;
 let y = 12;

 lessThan = (x < y) ? x is less than y : x is greater than y;
 ```
 // This returns 'x is less than y' as the value 2 is less than the value 12.

*Example2:*
